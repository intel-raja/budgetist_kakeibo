Surely, you have many times asked the question “ Where is my money going?" but cannot find a good answer. Kakeibo - Japanese ways to save money with "magic envelopes" will help you answer the question above.
# Kakeibo
The Kakeibo method of saving money was introduced in 1904 to housewives by the Japanese female journalist, Hani Motoko, for the purpose of managing the family budget.

Using the Kakeibo technique, you will learn "saving money is spending money properly" and “taking notes all of your financial activities in an organized way will help you to be aware of your spending habits”.It will help you say no to unreasonable expenses to achieve your savings goal.
